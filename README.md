# RC_Car_PC_Remote_Control
Control a 1/8th scale buggy from the computer using a steering wheel and pedals.
## Prerequisites
You need Qt, I am using Qt 5.10. I used a STM32L100CDISCO prototyping board for the hardware side, with systemworkbench as the IDE
and stm32cubemx to setup the skeleton code.
